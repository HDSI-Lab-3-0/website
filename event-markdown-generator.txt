# AI Prompt for Event Markdown Generation

## Instructions for AI

Generate a complete markdown document for an event following the specifications below. Your response must contain the entire markdown content in a single code block so it can be copied directly into the events collection.

## Frontmatter Fields

Include YAML/MDX frontmatter at the top of the file with these fields:

### Required Fields
- **eventName** (string): Official title of the event.
- **eventDescription** (string): One–sentence summary that appears in previews.
- **eventDateStart** (ISO 8601 datetime): Event start timestamp, e.g., `2024-11-15T08:30:00.000Z`.
- **eventDateEnd** (ISO 8601 datetime): Event end timestamp (same day or multi-day).
- **eventStatus** (string enum): Choose one of `upcoming`, `ongoing`, `completed`, or `cancelled`.
- **eventLocation** (string): Venue or delivery format (e.g., “Price Center Ballroom, UCSD” or “Online via Zoom”).
- **eventFor** (string): Primary audience/participants (e.g., “Middle school robotics clubs”).
- **eventTags** (array of strings): Mix of descriptive tags. Include at least one from each relevant category below so filtering works.

### Optional Fields
- **imageGif** (image path/URL): Animation to embed near the top of the event page.

## Tag Categories and Valid Options

When picking tags, prioritize these official category values; any extras fall into “Other” automatically:

### Location
- "in classroom"
- "out of classroom"
- "at UCSD"

### School Level
- "Elementary"
- "Middle School"
- "High School"
- "UCSD Undergraduate"
- "Community College"

### Sponsor
- "NSF TILOS"
- "NSF ENCORE"
- "HDSI LAB 3.0"

### Cost
- "Free"
- "Paid"
- "Offers Sponsorship"

### Type
- "Professional Development for Teachers"
- "Summer Day Camp"
- "Evening Workshops"

## Content Structure

After the frontmatter delimiter, write clear markdown optimized for the Event layout:

- Start with `#` heading repeating the event name, followed by a short overview paragraph.
- Use subheadings for agenda/schedule, key sessions, speakers, requirements, logistics, registration, audience expectations, and contact details.
- Highlight critical notices (e.g., cancellations) with bold text or blockquotes.
- Prefer lists for timelines or materials; tables for pricing tiers; callouts for quick facts.
- Embed components or placeholders (e.g., `<div id="..."></div>`) only when useful.
