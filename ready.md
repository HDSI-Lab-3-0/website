K–12 Students

Students can participate in Lab 3.0 experiences through their school or with family involvement. Programs are typically arranged through teachers or school partners, but families can also inquire about special events and workshops.

K–12 Teachers

We offer professional development, classroom visits, and hands-on curriculum aligned with NGSS standards. Our programs bring data science, engineering, and creativity directly into your classroom.

K–12 Families

We host on-campus summer programs and one-day workshops designed to introduce students to robotics, circuits, and data science through engaging, hands-on activities.

Undergraduate Students

Undergraduates can join as Lab Fellows, gaining experience in technical design, teaching, and leadership. Positions include paid academic-year roles as well as volunteer opportunities.

Faculty & Staff

We collaborate with faculty on grant-supported educational components and translate research into hands-on learning experiences. We also offer internal workshops to support student training and outreach initiatives.
