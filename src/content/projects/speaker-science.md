# Speaker Science (Build-a-Speaker Kit)

## Summary

A low-cost classroom kit to teach electromagnetism through building a working speaker—paired with data science tie-ins.

## K-12 Learning Goals

Hands-on physics; learn that signals/data can be turned into sound.

## Undergraduates Learning

Kit design for classroom constraints, cost reduction, iteration/testing.

## Overview

Create a speaker kit to teach kids about electromagnetism. Undergraduates will design the kit for classrooms. Cost low and easy to use. We are also tying it in with data science concepts.

## Kit Details

- **Focus**: Electromagnetism through hands-on building
- **Cost**: Low-cost design for classroom use
- **Integration**: Data science tie-ins included
- **Portability**: Classroom and outreach friendly
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
