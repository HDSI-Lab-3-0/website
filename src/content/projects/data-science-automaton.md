# Data Science Automaton

## Summary

Students collect friction data from different materials and build an automaton to learn about measurement, variables, and experimentation.

## K-12 Learning Goals

Data collection + experimental thinking; physical build tied to analysis.

## Undergraduates Learning

Facilitation and curriculum refinement.

## Overview

Participants learn about data science concepts by collecting data on different materials differing in friction. They build an automaton. The activity combines hands-on building with data analysis principles.

## Activity Details

- **Focus**: Friction measurement and data collection
- **Output**: Working automaton mechanism
- **Skills**: Measurement, variable identification, experimentation
- **Setting**: Classroom or lab environment
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
