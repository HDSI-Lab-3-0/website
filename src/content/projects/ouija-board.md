# Ouija Board (Magnetic + Voice-to-LLM)

## Summary

An interactive ouija-board-style canvas where a pointer moves magnetically while voice-to-text and an LLM generate responses.

## K-12 Learning Goals

Fun, spooky intro to electromagnetism + AI systems + language models.

## Undergraduates Learning

Magnetic actuation, speech-to-text pipeline, and building safe LLM interactions.

## Overview

Participants will be able to engage with a ouija board on a canvas where the point is magnetically moved around to the letters. Students learn how to magnetically move a piece on a canvas and also create a voice to text mechanism and also create an LLM that will respond to their questions.

## Demo Details

- **Technology**: Magnetic movement + voice-to-text + LLM integration
- **Experience**: Interactive question-answering format
- **Educational Value**: Introduction to multiple AI/physics concepts
- **Best For**: Demonstrations and inspiration
