# Robot Teddy Bear Army Scavenger Hunt & Parade

## Summary

A campus scavenger hunt where teams solve riddles and complete challenges, culminating in a robotic teddy bear parade.

## K-12 Learning Goals

Teamwork + playful intro to sensors, navigation, and interactive tech.

## Undergraduates Learning

Arduino + sensors for artifact verification, GPS/location logic, autonomous tracking, systems integration; collaboration with Theater/Dance on storytelling and design.
2.  **Enhance Student Well-being**: Use the bears to identify and respond to emotional states such as loneliness or engagement.
3.  **Promote Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Combine elements of technology, art, and user experience design, encouraging teamwork among students from engineering, art, theater, and data science.
4.  **Develop and Test Autonomous Technology**: Design bears capable of collecting data and ensuring the "March of the Teddy Bears" demonstrates successful autonomous navigation.
5.  **Gather Data Responsibly**: Collect meaningful insights on student engagement and well-being while respecting privacy and ethics.

## Specifications



### Hardware Requirements
* **RF Technology**: Short-range RF modules for proximity detection and Long-range RF or GPS for navigation.
* **Sensors**: Accelerometer and gyroscope for movement tracking, plus light and temperature sensors.
* **Power**: Rechargeable battery with 8-12 hours life and USB-C charging.
* **Actuators**: Small motors for movement or subtle actions like waving.

### Software Requirements
* **Clue Management**: Preprogrammed routes with unlockable clues and adaptive logic based on progress.
* **Data Collection**: Algorithms to assess user engagement and emotional insights.
* **Autonomy Module**: Basic AI navigation for following the queen bear and communication protocols for synchronized movement.

### Physical & Connectivity
* **Design**: Compact (1-2 lbs), durable, weatherproof, and featuring a friendly teddy bear appearance.
* **Connectivity**: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for user interaction and RF for location updates.

### Safety and Ethics
* **Privacy**: Data anonymization to protect user identity and clear consent forms.
* **Safety**: Emergency shutoff mechanisms and low battery notifications.

## Implementation Milestones

### Phase 1: Concept Development
* Finalize goals, specifications, and ethical considerations regarding privacy.
* Recruit a multidisciplinary team (engineering, data science, theater).

### Phase 2: Prototype Development
* **Hardware**: Build a basic prototype with RF modules and sensors; test durability.
* **Software**: Develop clue management systems and a mobile interface.
* **Integration**: Combine components and test clue delivery and navigation.

### Phase 3: Pilot Testing
* Distribute a limited number of bears to a small student group to test accuracy and engagement.
* Refine technical issues and optimize data collection.

### Phase 4: Full Deployment
* Launch campus-wide with a larger group and monitor scalability.
* Analyze collected data (e.g., emotional state trends).

### Phase 5 & 6: The March and Evaluation
* Plan the parade route and test the autonomous movement system.
* Execute the "March of the Teddy Bears" with the queen teddy bear leading.
* Collect feedback, document lessons learned, and plan future iterations.
