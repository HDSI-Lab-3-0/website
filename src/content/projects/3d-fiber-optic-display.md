### Hardware Requirements
* **Fiber Optic Cables**: High-quality cables to ensure clear light transmission and flexibility.
* **Servo Motors**: Precision servo motors to control the movement of the cables.
* **Frame and Mounts**: A robust structure to hold the fiber optics and servomotors securely.
* **Lighting System**: LED sources to illuminate the fiber optics with vibrant colors.

### Software Requirements
* **Control Software**: Algorithms to translate input data into servomotor movements, supporting pre-programmed patterns and real-time user input.
* **Interactive Features**: A user interface for pattern selection or live interaction, and an API for integrating external data sources.
* **Visualization Engine**: Tools for simulating and previewing patterns before they are displayed.

### Performance & Design
The system aims for precise, smooth movements and bright, evenly distributed light. It requires a real-time response to user inputs with minimal latency. The physical design will feature a sleek, modern look that is compact and portable for demonstrations.

## Implementation Milestones

### Phase 1: Concept and Design
* Define system requirements and technical specifications.

* Recruit members with expertise in robotics, software development, and design.

### Phase 2: Prototype Development
* **Hardware**: Assemble the frame with mounted fiber optics and servomotors, testing for precision and light transmission.
* **Software**: Develop basic control software and test static/dynamic patterns.
* **Integration**: Synchronize hardware and software to create basic images, adjusting for smooth motion and uniform lighting.

### Phase 3: Interactivity Development
* Develop a user-friendly interface for pattern selection.
* Implement real-time input processing for interactive visualizations.

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
* Conduct stress tests for prolonged operation and gather feedback from early users.
* Finalize the physical design for durability and optimize software for performance.

### Phase 5 & 6: Deployment and Evaluation
* Showcase the display at internal events and train team members.
* Organize a public launch event with live demonstrations.
* Collect feedback, evaluate interactivity, and explore enhancements like AR/VR integration.
