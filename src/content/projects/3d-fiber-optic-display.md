# 3D Fiber Optic Display

## Overview

The 3D Fiber Optic Display is an innovative project that merges art, technology, and data science to create dynamic, interactive visualizations. Using fiber optic cables controlled by servo motors, the display translates software-generated patterns into captivating three-dimensional images. By integrating precise hardware control with data-driven software, the display serves as both an artistic installation and an educational tool, inspiring students and audiences to explore the intersections of data and creativity.

## Goals

The project focuses on four main objectives:

1.  **Create a Captivating Visual Experience**: Use fiber optics and servo motors to generate intricate, three-dimensional images and explore the artistic possibilities of combining motion and light.
2.  **Highlight the Creativity in Data Science**: Demonstrate how data-driven algorithms can produce dynamic visual effects and inspire audiences by showcasing the interdisciplinary applications of data science.
3.  **Develop an Interactive Platform**: Design software that allows users to interact with and influence the display, enabling real-time visualization of data or user-generated patterns.
4.  **Educational Outreach**: Use the display as a teaching tool to engage students in topics like data visualization, programming, and robotics.
