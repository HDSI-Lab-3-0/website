# Parent/Child Robotic Arts & Crafts Workshop

## Summary

A 3-hour parent/child lab experience learning circuits, Arduino basics, and robotics through creative making (pizza included).

## K-12 Learning Goals

Build confidence in circuits + programming; connect robotics to data science foundations.

## Undergraduates Learning

Facilitation, teaching, kit setup, troubleshooting, and curriculum refinement.

## Overview

This workshop creates an opportunity for parents to work with their kids to learn about basic programming, circuits, and robotics. One parent and one child come to our lab and enjoy a 3-hour experience. Pizza is included. Parents work with their child to learn about basic programming with an Arduino, basic circuits, and robotics. We share how programming is one of the fundamental skills for data science. Participants get to keep their entire creation.
