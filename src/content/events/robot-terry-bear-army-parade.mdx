# Robot Teddy Bear Army Parade

The Queen Bear summons all her knights!  
After two weeks of riddles, adventures, and training across campus, the Robot Teddy Bear Army is ready to march. This grand parade will celebrate the Queen Bear, her newly trained teddy bear knights, and all the brave teams who joined the mission. Join us for an energetic, whimsical, and community-driven showcase of teddy bear spirit and UC San Diego creativity.

## Event Overview

This parade marks the finale of the campus-wide Robot Teddy Bear Army adventure series. Students and teams who participated in puzzle challenges, training missions, and bear-themed quests will gather to march, celebrate, and revel in the achievement of completing the Queen Bear’s trials.
