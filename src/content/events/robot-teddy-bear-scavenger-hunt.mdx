# 2025 Robot Teddy Bear Army Scavenger Hunt

From October 13–27, teams across UC San Diego joined forces to help the **Queen Bear** train her growing army of teddy bear knights. Each group received a custom teddy bear embedded with hidden electronics, designed to assist in solving riddles and tagging artifacts at locations across campus.

The event blended exploration, problem-solving, community engagement, and just a bit of chaos—all in the spirit of the first-ever **Robot Teddy Bear Army Scavenger Hunt and Parade**.

---

## How the Scavenger Hunt Worked

Participants were challenged to complete 20 locations across UCSD, with each stop revealed through a unique riddle. Upon solving a clue and reaching the correct destination:

1. **Use your teddy bear to “tag” the artifact** at that location.
2. Your bear then **reveals a password** to unlock a short survey.
3. Surveys determined **what kind of knight your teddy bear is becoming**.
4. **Take a photo** at each location (bonus points for group shots!).
5. Use hints sparingly—**they cost points**!

A surprise activity was teased throughout the event… and may return next year.

## Rewards

The top three fastest teams **won prizes** for each member. To qualify for ranking, all teams were required to:

- Submit **photos at every location**
- Complete **all riddle surveys**
- Minimize the number of hints used

---

## Knight Categories

Each teddy bear revealed its “training path” based on participant surveys, falling under one of six knight types:

- **Bard / Storyteller** – Charismatic, inspiring, a natural leader
- **Wizard / Magician** – Intelligent, curious, always seeking knowledge
- **Paladin / Personal Guard** – Loyal, honest, and brave
- **Cleric / Healer** – Empathetic, selfless, and caring
- **Artificer / Engineer** – Creative, logical, and inventive
- **Rogue / Rebel** – Cunning, independent, and daring

## Social Media & Community

Photos from teams will be featured once the **official Robot Teddy Bear Army Instagram** launches. Expect adorable bears, heroic poses, and plenty of mischief.
